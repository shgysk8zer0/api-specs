**This is the specification, not an implementation. It is not intended to be specific
to any given programming language or database.**

If you wish to add or modify definitions of any vocabulary / schema, this is not
the place to do so. If you have an issue regarding the vocabulary itself, file
an issue on [schema.org's Github page](http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues)

Additional fields may, given sufficient reason, be added to the available fields.
Note, however, that no additions to schemas or vocabularies will **ever** be added
to responses.
